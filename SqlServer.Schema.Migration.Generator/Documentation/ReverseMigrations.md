# Reverse Migrations (Deprecated)

## Status: DEPRECATED

**As of August 2025, reverse migration generation has been removed from the system.**

## Previous Functionality

The SQL Server Migration Generator previously created reverse migration scripts alongside forward migration scripts. These reverse scripts contained SQL statements that would undo the changes made by the forward migration.

## Why Removed

1. **Complexity**: Reverse migrations for complex schema changes (especially table recreations with data transformations) were often incomplete or incorrect
2. **Safety**: Manual rollback of database changes requires careful consideration of data integrity and business logic
3. **Better Alternatives**: Modern deployment practices favor:
   - Database snapshots before migration
   - Backup and restore procedures
   - Forward-only migrations with compensating changes when needed
   - Blue-green deployments for zero-downtime rollbacks

## Recommended Rollback Strategies

Instead of reverse migrations, consider these approaches:

### 1. Database Snapshots
Create a database snapshot before applying migrations:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE MyDatabase_Snapshot_20250812 
ON (NAME = MyDatabase_Data, FILENAME = 'C:\Snapshots\MyDatabase_20250812.ss')
AS SNAPSHOT OF MyDatabase;
```

### 2. Full Backup
Take a full backup before migration:
```sql
BACKUP DATABASE MyDatabase 
TO DISK = 'C:\Backups\MyDatabase_PreMigration_20250812.bak'
WITH FORMAT, INIT;
```

### 3. Forward-Only Compensation
Create a new migration that compensates for unwanted changes rather than trying to reverse them.

### 4. Testing Environment
Always test migrations in a non-production environment first.

## Migration History

The `DatabaseMigrationHistory` table continues to track applied migrations for audit purposes, but without reverse migration references.

## Legacy Reverse Migrations

If you have existing reverse migrations in `z_migrations_reverse` folders from before this change, they can be:
- Kept for historical reference
- Manually executed if absolutely necessary (with extreme caution)
- Deleted if no longer needed
